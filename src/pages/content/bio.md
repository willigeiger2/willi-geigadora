# Bio

I was born in a small town in North Yorkshire, England,
in the second half of the 20th century.

The first year of my life I remember was with a traveling circus in which my
mother was the fire-eater. It's given me a lifelong love of spectacle.

When I was a little older, I moved to Edinburgh, Scotland,
my adopted hometown.
Soon after I moved there, a movie called _"Star Wars"_
became a huge hit, and literally changed my life.
Some of my friends wanted to be Princess Leia or Luke Skywalker,
but I dreamed of creating those alien worlds and creatures.

In 2001 I managed to make the dream
come true, and moved from London to California to work on visual effects for
Lucasfilm's Industrial Light + Magic. I got to work on around twenty Hollywood
movies, including couple of Star Wars prequels.

In 2014, a friend of a friend approached me about an idea for _Heirloom_,
a startup in the social photography space.
I was ready for a change, and everyone else in San Francisco was doing it,
so why not? It was a fun year -- working out of the top floor of a converted
warehouse in the heart of SOMA, near the SF Giants ballpark.
Coffee shops on every corner bustling with tech entrepreneurs
and their Macbooks.

When _Heirloom_ was acquired, I went full on Silicon Valley big tech.
I helped get YouTube running on hundreds of millions of smart TVs and set-top
boxes. I led the team that developed the camera, editing and effects for
YouTube Shorts.
I spent some time at Netflix helping build a virtual animation studio in the
cloud.

Now I lead engineering for Cloudflare's Media Platform: Images, Stream,
Realtime and Cloudflare TV. We run media services at large scale, built
on Cloudflare's Developer Platform and edge network (over 300 points of presence around the world).
And if you don't know about Cloudflare's Developer
Platform powered by Workers, check it out -- it is amazing technology.
Everything on this site is built with Cloudflare Workers (and Astro!).

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with family and being in nature.
I'm a keen amateur photographer -- I'll get some photos on this site soon!
